# @coderich/dalmatian
#### A unified API for data access.
:heavy_check_mark: [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/)
:heavy_check_mark: [Neo4j](https://https://neo4j.com/)

**Dalmatian** is a unified API to treat disparate data sources as one coherent graph. Inspired by [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/), it is the *resolver* responsible for executing queries.

:star: If you are looking for a GraphQL API, check out [AutoGraph](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coderich/autograph)!

## Getting Started
```
const resolver = new Dalmatian(schema);
```
