Ideas:
  * Create a Document/Record class
    - hydrate, dehydrate, cast, etc
  * Create a GQLParser class to consolidate Model and Field classes... pass raw gql to data/Model, data/Field

Bugs:
  * Casting must be bi-directional
  * Can you count Bids?

Todo:
  * Error handling; Rules need error messages
  * Mutation should have meta input (how to define meta props?)
  * Get a list of references that would be onDelete affected

Figure out:
  * publishedDate. Cannot be set via CRUD; only set via meta action...
  * createdBy? (Audit trail)
  * Dyncamic Required Fields. (eg. title required if no background image)
  * ValidateMultiLang. How would you implement this kind of validation?
  * Context. (tenants, segmentation, language)
  * Authorization. Specifically owner records, segmentation, recursion

Open Questions:
  * Is GLOB where-clause a good idea?
  * Where/How to define stores?

Integration Concerns
  * AutoGraph returns base64 id's for pagination; how to mix APIs and slowly migrate?
