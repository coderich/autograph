Release 0.6:
  ** WRITE A TEST THAT SHOWS resolveModelWhereClause (if (where.id) where.id = map(where.id, v => model.idValue(v));)
    - its needed...

  * Add ability to query (where, first, last, etc) nested array types
    - Should return ConnectionType
  ? Possibly rename input type to end with Input (eg. CreatePersonInput)
  * deserialize should set default values if undefined
  * helper methods:
    - field.getPathFromModel(model) => 'a.b.c.d';
  -------------

Bugs:
  * Nested embedded object in array cannot delete without doing an explicit $pull operation (race condition)
    - Drivers need concept of push and pull
  * DataLoaders are not being used propertly - need re-architecture
  * MongoDB cannot-create-namespace-in-multi-document-transaction (collection must first be defined)

Performance:
  * Select as alias/key can be done at the driver level (not require transformation during hydration)
  * Pagination should pass limit & sort to dao if possible
    - Can all queries default sort by _id? Is this the Mongo default thing to do?
  * Post-Query hydration needs to be faster
  * Verify that Transformer + Rules are only being called when needed

Next:
  * Incorporate Logger
  * You know EventEmitter wants to emit Query (will be a breaking change so consider when to do it)
  * Support @value on Model itself?
  * Framework directive param validation
  * Take a look at all Mongoose options/features (eg. minimize)
  * Neo4j does not know how to generate ids
    - ID Value Strategy (MongoID, String, etc)
  * Deserialization and ids (_id) and code throughout (remove _id in deserlialization if possible)
  * How do you handle the hydrate() problem? QueryWorker is hydrating, what about concept of returning ResultSet and letting user hydrate() or populate() from resolver?
  * I don't think you have "distinct" and "noRepeat" figured out and implemented (you can move noRepeat to enforce)

Enhancements:
  * Lodash Transformers
  * Create person with books at the same time
  * createdAt, updatedAt, counts, onDeletes, references, etc should be controllable
  * ResultSet can have helper methods (save(), remove(), archive(), etc())
  * Add 'filterBy' as an option for post query filtering (this can alleviate the depth-first where clause problem)
  * Concept of "incomplete" and "what's missing" as part of data retrieval
  * Get a list of references that would be onDelete affected
  * URL, RGB, RGBA, validator?
  * Composite Rule Definitions?

Todo:
  * MeteorUser _id is a String (not ID). How to handle?
    - How about expicit ID definition?
  * Currently there is no way to count regular elements of an array (try to count bids)
  * Allow Field and Model to be extended (directive fields)
  * Are you able to flatten fields? (ie. firstName, lastName but save to profile.firstName, profile.lastName in DB)
    - Confirmed that you cannot.
  * Input types are not models and therefor cannot participate in Transformers|Rules
    - Is this really needed? I guess perhaps when using the DOA directly...
  * Embedded documents (outside of Mongo) do not work!
    - How to handle join-table in SQL?
    - How to create index on embedded objects? building.type unique?

Ideas:
  * If the Query holds all the information you can move logic to it (eg. Query.validate())
  * Can you use semver over glob in some areas?

Figure out:
  * createdBy? (Audit trail)
  * Authorization. Specifically owner records, segmentation, recursive data resolution
  * dependencies vs peerDependencies (graphql)
  * What was the reason for Query vs Find? Do you need it? I know it had to do with final stage of sorting/filtering/pagination.

How:
  data: {
    type: Mongo.Mixed,
    required: true,
    $onDelete: {
      key: 'data.id',
      op: 'unset',
      $set: { '../../../status': 'incomplete' },
      ref: {
        Category: { '../../type': 'category' },
        NetworkCuratedList: { '../../type': 'list', network_id: { $exists: 1 } },
      },
    },
  }
