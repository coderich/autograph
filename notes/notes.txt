Release v0.10:
  * immutable makes no sense as part of pipeline - should consider "immutable" directive
  * immutable does not even work past the top-level attribute!!!

  *** You currently have a "validate" event to allow async blocks ***
    - "validate" is actually used as a last step AFTER all other transforms/events have happened to do one final step
    - validation is different from Pipeline - it can do things like make sure multiple fields exist together, etc
    - Autograph @field is at an atomic level - therefore I believe "validation" event should be a first-class citizen
      - So then what does "validate: false" mean?
    - "immutable" is part of this "validation" process (not the pipeline)

  * Transform + Rules => Pipeline?
    - If you combine, how do you turn off validation per say?
      - Filter our functions of kind = 'Rule'
    - Need to bottom out on the order of pipeline operations
    - Sync (remove ensureId)
    - Rule => return value or throw? (throw)
    - Use of $<pipeline-name> to denote AG vs user-defined? (yes)
  * Verify that Transformer + Rules are only being called when needed

  *** There is a bug "where: { id: {one,two,three} }" does not work

  * Determine attribute order when shaping data => this is how we want it saved to db
    - _id
    - fk ids
    - scalars
    - embedded objects
    - arrays
  * Resolver.toResultSet() => How to hydrate results from the outside world?
    - resolver.match('NetworkPlace', { validate: false, silent: true, debug: true, shape: true }).toResult(data)
    - resolver.raw('NetworkPlace', { shape: true });
  * SchemaDecorator mutates schema passed in constructor => make sure that's OK
  * Revisit update $doc/merge => make sure it's OK
  * Splice Embedded Array => make sure it's OK
  * Can you detect GLOB-ISH string => more optimal query?
  * Can QueryBuilder be re-used => If not, prevent re-use
  * Tests do not clean up open Mongo connection

  * Finalize Driver Interface - consider moving out of Autograph into new NPM module
  * Database connection pooling?
  * Resolver.disconnect()
  * Tests comprehensive enough?

  * "root" is misnomer => "doc"
  * Optimize/Cache information needed for Pipeline
  * @field(ref: "???") => Does this work? How to use it? Rename it?
    * Allow FK by arbitrary value (ie. workspace.name)
  * Consider fixing API traveral problem:
    - If @model is omitted, it's a leaf, and embedded but no magic attributes added
  * EventEmitter().setMaxListeners(100) => Is this smelly?
  * Revisit SystemEvent args
  * It's unclear if where clause needs
    - "castValue" Transformation
    - QueryService.resolveWhereClause -> if (where.id) where.id = map(where.id, v => model.idValue(v));
    - Write a test that shows if any of these are needed

  ** Fields with alias (keys) as the same name as other fields do not save properly eg:
      DataPackage.network: Network @field(key: "networkId") # Collides with networkId field
      DataPackage.networkId: ID # Legacy attribute so it's still needed

Next Release:
  * Would be nice to query in mode where none of the @value stuff is used (migration scripts etc)
  * Allow input to be data model (not just graphql schema)
  * Finalize flags() vs options() - possibly use resolver.match(model, flags)
  * Deep sort (akin to where clause resolution?)
    - You are currently thwarted since key order is not preserved...

Bugs:
  * Nested embedded object in array cannot delete without doing an explicit $pull operation (race condition)
    - Drivers need concept of push and pull
  * MongoDB cannot-create-namespace-in-multi-document-transaction (collection must first be defined)
  * Embedded documents get their updatedBy field changed even when they don't change

Next:
  * Incorporate Logger
  * Neo4j does not know how to generate ids
    - ID Value Strategy (MongoID, String, etc)
  * I don't think you have "distinct" and "noRepeat" figured out and implemented (you can move noRepeat to enforce)
  ? Possibly rename input type to end with Input (eg. CreatePersonInput)

Enhancements:
  * Create person with books at the same time
  * Add 'filterBy' as an option for post query filtering (this can alleviate the depth-first where clause problem)
  * Concept of "incomplete" and "what's missing" as part of data retrieval
  * Get a list of references that would be onDelete affected
  * Composite Rule Definitions?

Todo:
  * MeteorUser _id is a String (not ID). How to handle?
    - How about expicit ID definition?
  * Allow Field and Model to be extended (directive fields)
  * Are you able to flatten fields? (ie. firstName, lastName but save to profile.firstName, profile.lastName in DB)
    - Confirmed that you cannot.
  * Input types are not models and therefor cannot participate in Transformers|Rules
    - Is this really needed? I guess perhaps when using the DOA directly...
  * Embedded documents (outside of Mongo) do not work!
    - How to handle join-table in SQL?
    - How to create index on embedded objects? building.type unique?

Ideas:
  * If the Query holds all the information you can move logic to it (eg. Query.validate())
  * Can you use semver over glob in some areas?

Figure out:
  * createdBy? (Audit trail)
  * Authorization. Specifically owner records, segmentation, recursive data resolution

How:
  data: {
    type: Mongo.Mixed,
    required: true,
    $onDelete: {
      key: 'data.id',
      op: 'unset',
      $set: { '../../../status': 'incomplete' },
      ref: {
        Category: { '../../type': 'category' },
        NetworkCuratedList: { '../../type': 'list', network_id: { $exists: 1 } },
      },
    },
  }
